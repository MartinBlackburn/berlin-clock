#Berlin clock
The Berlin Uhr (Clock) is a unique way to show the time.  
  
On the top of the clock there is a yellow light that blinks on/off every two seconds.  
  
The next two rows of lights indicate the hours of a day.   
In the top of these two rows there are 4 lights, every light represents 5 hours.   
In the lower row, every light represents 1 hour.   
So if two lights if the first row and three in the second are switched on that indicates 5+5+3=13h or 1pm.  
  
The last two rows count the minutes.  
The first of these rows has 11 lights, each light represents 5 minutes. The 3rd, 6th and 9th lamp are red and indicate the first quarter, half and last quarter of an hour. the other lights are yellow.   
In the last row each light represents 1 minute.
